# MNIST
## Overview
This repository contains a basic MNIST image classification project, which serves as an excellent starting point for anyone entering the field of image classification. MNIST is a well-known dataset consisting of handwritten digits, commonly used for benchmarking machine learning algorithms in the computer vision domain.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) and their corresponding labels. It contains a total of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of correctly classifying these digits based on the pixel intensities.

## Model Architecture
In this project, we use a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify the MNIST images. The CNN comprises convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification.
